fallacy_name,description
Appeal to probability,taking something for granted because it would probably be the case (or might possibly be the case).[3][4]
Argument from fallacy (also known as the fallacy fallacy),"the assumption that, if a particular argument for a ""conclusion"" is fallacious, then the conclusion by itself is false.[5]"
Base rate fallacy,"making a probability judgment based on conditional probabilities, without taking into account the effect of prior probabilities.[6]"
Conjunction fallacy,the assumption that an outcome simultaneously satisfying multiple conditions is more probable than an outcome satisfying a single one of them.[7]
Non sequitur fallacy,where the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.[8]
Masked-man fallacy (illicit substitution of identicals),the substitution of identical designators in a true statement can lead to a false one.[9]
Affirming a disjunct,"concluding that one disjunct of a logical disjunction must be false because the other disjunct is true; A or B; A, therefore not B.[10]"
Affirming the consequent,"the antecedent in an indicative conditional is claimed to be true because the consequent is true; if A, then B; B, therefore A.[10]"
Denying the antecedent,"the consequent in an indicative conditional is claimed to be false because the antecedent is false; if A, then B; not A, therefore not B.[10]"
Existential fallacy,an argument that has a universal premise and a particular conclusion.[11]
Affirmative conclusion from a negative premise (illicit negative),"a categorical syllogism has a positive conclusion, but at least one negative premise.[11]"
Fallacy of exclusive premises,a categorical syllogism that is invalid because both of its premises are negative.[11]
Fallacy of four terms (quaternio terminorum),a categorical syllogism that has four terms.[12]
Illicit major,a categorical syllogism that is invalid because its major term is not distributed in the major premise but distributed in the conclusion.[11]
Illicit minor,a categorical syllogism that is invalid because its minor term is not distributed in the minor premise but distributed in the conclusion.[11]
Negative conclusion from affirmative premises (illicit affirmative),a categorical syllogism has a negative conclusion but affirmative premises.[11]
Fallacy of the undistributed middle,the middle term in a categorical syllogism is not distributed.[13]
Modal fallacy,"confusing necessity with sufficiency. A condition X is necessary for Y if X is required for even the possibility of Y. X does not bring about Y by itself, but if there is no X, there will be no Y. For example, oxygen is necessary for fire. But one cannot assume that everywhere there is oxygen, there is fire. A condition X is sufficient for Y if X, by itself, is enough to bring about Y. For example, riding the bus is a sufficient mode of transportation to get to work. But there are other modes of transportation – car, taxi, bicycle, walking – that can be used."
Modal scope fallacy,a degree of unwarranted necessity is placed in the conclusion.
Argument from incredulity,"when someone can't imagine something to be true, and therefore deems it false, or conversely, holds that it must be true because they can't see how it could be false.[15]"

Divine fallacy (argument from incredulity),"arguing that, because something is so phenomenal or amazing, it must be the result of superior, divine, alien or paranormal agency.[19]"
Double counting,"counting events or occurrences more than once in probabilistic reasoning, which leads to the sum of the probabilities of all cases exceeding unity."
Equivocation,"using a term with more than one meaning in a statement without specifying which meaning is intended.[20]
Ambiguous middle term – using a middle term with multiple meanings.[21]
Definitional retreat – changing the meaning of a word when an objection is raised.[22] Often paired with moving the goalposts (see below), as when an argument is challenged using a common definition of a term in the argument, and the arguer presents a different definition of the term and thereby demands different evidence to debunk the argument.
Motte-and-bailey fallacy – conflating two positions with similar properties, one modest and easy to defend (the ""motte"") and one more controversial (the ""bailey"").[23] The arguer first states the controversial position, but when challenged, states that they are advancing the modest position.[24][25]
Fallacy of accent – changing the meaning of a statement by not specifying on which word emphasis falls.
Persuasive definition – purporting to use the ""true"" or ""commonly accepted"" meaning of a term while, in reality, using an uncommon or altered definition.

False equivalence,describing two or more statements as virtually equal when they are not.
Feedback fallacy,believing in the objectivity of an evaluation to be used as the basis for improvement without verifying that the source of the evaluation is a disinterested party.[32]
Historian's fallacy,"assuming that decision-makers of the past had identical information as those subsequently analyzing the decision.[33] This is not to be confused with presentism, in which present-day ideas and perspectives are anachronistically projected into the past."
Historical fallacy,"believing that certain results occurred only because a specific process was performed, though said process may actually be unrelated to the results.[34]

Kettle logic,"using multiple, jointly inconsistent arguments to defend a position."
Ludic fallacy,failing to take into account that non-regulated random occurrences unknown unknowns can affect the probability of an event taking place.[40]

"Reification (concretism, hypostatization, or the fallacy of misplaced concreteness) – treating an abstract belief or hypothetical construct as if it were a concrete, real event or physical entity (e.g.",saying that evolution selects which traits are passed on to future generations; evolution is not a conscious entity with agency).
"Retrospective determinism – believing that, because an event has occurred under some circumstance, the circumstance must have made the event inevitable (e.g.","because someone won the lottery while wearing their lucky socks, wearing those socks made winning the lottery inevitable)."
"Slippery slope (thin edge of the wedge, camel's nose)","asserting that a proposed, relatively small, first action will inevitably lead to a chain of related events resulting in a significant and negative event and, therefore, should not be permitted.[45]"
Special pleading – the arguer attempts to cite something as an exemption to a generally accepted rule or principle without justifying the exemption (e.g.,an orphaned defendant who murdered their parents asking for leniency).

Begging the question (petitio principii) – using the conclusion of the argument in support of itself in a premise (e.g.,"saying that smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you; something that kills is deadly).[46][47]
Loaded label – while not inherently fallacious, the use of evocative terms to support a conclusion is a type of begging the question fallacy. When fallaciously used, the term's connotations are relied on to sway the argument towards a particular conclusion. For example, in an organic foods advertisement that says ""Organic foods are safe and healthy foods grown without any pesticides, herbicides, or other unhealthy additives"", the terms ""safe"" and ""healthy"" are used to fallaciously imply that non-organic foods are neither safe nor healthy.[48]"
